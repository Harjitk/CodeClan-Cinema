# week-3-weekend-hw-CCC

I created a system which handles bookings for a cinema which is made up of customer, film and ticket classes. 
I applied CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete to each of the classes. I completed MVP by showing which films a customer 
had booked to see and which customers were coming to see one film.
